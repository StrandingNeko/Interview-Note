# 1 Terminology

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **hart**    | A RISC-V compatible core might support multiple RISC-V-compatible **hardware threads**. |
| **core**    | A component  contains an independent instruction fetch unit. |
| accelerator | either a non-programmable fixed-function unit or a core that can operate autonomously but is specialized for certain tasks. |
| coprocessor | a unit that is attached to a RISC-V core and is mostly sequenced by a RISC-V instruction stream, but which contains additional architectural state and instruction-set extensions, and possibly some limited autonomy relative to the primary RISC-V instruction stream. |

# 2 Memory

A RISC-V hart has a single byte-addressable address space of 2^XLEN^ bytes for all memory accesses.

> XLEN will be defined in compiler header files commonly.
