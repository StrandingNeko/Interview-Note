| **hart**    | A RISC-V compatible core might support multiple RISC-V-compatible **hardware threads**. |
| **core**    | A component  contains an independent instruction fetch unit. |
| accelerator | either a non-programmable fixed-function unit or a core that can operate autonomously but is specialized for certain tasks. |
| coprocessor | a unit that is attached to a RISC-V core and is mostly sequenced by a RISC-V instruction stream, but which contains additional architectural state and instruction-set extensions, and possibly some limited autonomy relative to the primary RISC-V instruction stream. |

# 2 Memory

A RISC-V hart has a single byte-addressable address space of 2^XLEN^ bytes for all memory accesses.

> XLEN will be defined in compiler header files commonly.

# 4 Instructions

## 4.1 RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set

1. 40 unique instructions;
2. 32 x registers each 32 bits wide:
   - Register **x0** is hardwired with all bits equal to 0. 
   - General purpose registers **x1- x31** hold values that various instructions interpret as a collection of Boolean values, or as twoâ€™s complement signed binary integers or unsigned binary integers.
3. one additional unprivileged register: the program counter **pc** holds the address of the current instruction.

> **Note:**
>
> 1. any x register can be stack pointer or subroutine return address link register;
> 2. generally, the standard software calling convention uses register **x1** to **hold the return address for a call**, with register **x5** available as **an alternate link register**. The standard calling convention uses register **x2** as the **stack pointer**.

## 4.6 "C" Extension for Compressed Instructions

short 16-bit instruction encodings for common operations. Typically, 50%-60% of the RISC-V instructions in a program can be replaced with RVC instructions, resulting in a 25%-30% code-size reduction.

RVC uses a simple compression scheme that offers shorter 16-bit versions of common 32-bit RISC-Vinstructions when:

1. the **immediate or address offset is small**, or
2. **one of the registers is the zero register (x0), the ABI link register (x1), or the ABI stack pointer (x2)**, or 
3. the **destination register and the first source register are identical**, or
4. the **registers used are the 8 most popular ones**.
